# Types

This categorization allows for a more organized and structured approach to managing and analyzing data. Each "Type" typically shares a common characteristic or purpose, making it easier to manage, filter, and interpret data.

At present, these types are fixed and unchangeable as constants, but there are plans to make them adjustable in the near future.

The available types include:

- Portfolio
- Income
- Mortgage
- Mortgage Rate
- Cotisation
- Dividend
- House Expenses
- Expenses
